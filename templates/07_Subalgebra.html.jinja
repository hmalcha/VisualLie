    In [<a href="#FF">1</a>], it was shown that there exists a decomposition
    of $\mathcal{F}$ with respect to a rank 2 affine subalgebra.
    Consider the generalized Cartan matrix
    
    \begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix} 2 & -2 \\ -2 & 2 \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align}

    and the associated affine subalgebra $A_1^{(1)}$ of $\mathcal{F}$
    generated by $\{e_i, f_i, h_i \ | \ i = 1, 2 \}$. An explicit
    description of $A_1^{(1)}$ is given by

    \begin{align}
    A_1^{(1)} = \mathrm{span}_\mathbb{R} \left\{ E_m, F_m, H_m \, (m \in \mathbb{Z}) , K , \mathfrak{d} \right\}
    \end{align}

    with the standard commutation relations

    \begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
    &[H_m, E_m] = 2 E_{m+n},  &&[H_m, F_m] = -2F_{m+n} \, , \\
    &[E_m, F_n] = H_{m+n} + m K \delta_{m+n,0} \, ,  &&[H_m, H_n] = 2m K \delta_{m+n,0} \, , \\
    &[E_m, E_n] = [F_m, F_n] = 0 \, .
    \end{aligned}
    \end{align}

    Furthermore,

    \begin{align}
    K = h_0 + h_1 \, , \quad \mathfrak{d} = h_{-1} + h_0 + h_1 \, ,
    \end{align}

    where $K$ commutes with all affine generators and
    $\mathfrak{d}$ is the depth counting operator with

    \begin{align}
    [\mathfrak{d}, T_m] = - m T_m \quad \text{for all} \quad T_m \in \{E_m, F_m, H_m\} \, .
    \end{align}

    Together with $h_1$, the operators $K$ and $\mathfrak{d}$ span the 
    Cartan subalgebra $A_1^{(1)}$ of $\mathcal{F}$. After these preparations 
    the algebra $\mathcal{F}$ can be decomposed into eigenspaces of $K$

    \begin{align}
    \mathcal{F} = \bigoplus_{\ell \in \mathbb{Z}} \mathcal{F}^{(\ell)}
    \end{align}

    In particular $\mathcal{F}^{(0)} = A_1^{(1)}$ and 
    $\mathcal{F}^{(1)} = L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0)$. The highest weight vector 
    in $L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0)$ is 
    $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0 + 2 \boldsymbol{\delta} = - \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1}$. 
    This is the level decomposition of $\mathcal{F}$, and it is exactly what is 
    shown in the figures above. Each subspace $\mathcal{F}^{(\ell)}$ decomposes into 
    (generally infinitely many) irreducible representations of $A_1^{(1)}$. 
    The subspace $\mathcal{F}^{(-\ell)}$ is conjugate to $\mathcal{F}^{(\ell)}$ 
    and thus needs not be studied separately. The level-$\ell$ subspace 
    $\mathcal{F}^{(\ell)}$ is spanned by the multi-commutators 
    $[f_{i_1}, \ldots , [f_{i_{n-1}}, f_{i_n}] \ldots]$ with $\ell$ generators 
    $f_{-1}$. Subsequently, it can be shown that [<a href="#FF">1</a>]

    \begin{align}
    \mathcal{F}^{(\ell)} = \left[ \mathcal{F}^{(1)} , \mathcal{F}^{(\ell-1)} \right] \, .
    \end{align}

    Let $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^\ast$. For each $i = -1, 0, 1$ we define
    the fundamental Weyl reflection $r_i$ of the space $\mathfrak{h}^\ast$ by
    
    \begin{align}
    r_i(\lambda) = \lambda - \left< \lambda, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i^\vee \right> \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i \, .
    \end{align}
    The subgroup $W \subset \mathrm{GL}(\mathfrak{h}^\ast)$ generated by
    all fundamental reflections is called the Weyl group of $\mathfrak{g}(A)$.
</p>
<p>
    A root $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \Delta$ is called real if there exists
    $w \in W$ such that $w(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ is a simple root. For the
    Feingold-Frenkel algebra $\mathcal{F}$ all real roots have norm 2, i.e.
    $ (\boldsymbol{\alpha} , \boldsymbol{\alpha} ) = 2$. Here $(\cdot, \cdot)$
    is the symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form defined by
    $(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_j) = a_{ij}$. 
</p>
<p>
    The following statements about real roots $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ are
    important for constructing the root system of $\mathcal{F}$:
</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>$\mathrm{mult}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = 1$.</li>
        <li>$k  \boldsymbol{\alpha}$ is a root if and only of $k = \pm 1$.</li>
        <li>
            If $ \boldsymbol{\beta} \in \Delta$ then there exist nonnegative
            integers $p$ and $q$ related by the equation

            \begin{align}\label{eq:Root}
            p-q = \left<  \boldsymbol{\beta},  \boldsymbol{\alpha}^\vee \right> \, , 
            \end{align}

            such that $\boldsymbol{\beta} + k \boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \Delta \cup \{0\}$
            if and only if $-p \le k \le q$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p> 
    A root that is not real is called imaginary. Imaginary roots have norm $\le 0$.
    From the statements above, it follows in particular that if
    $\boldsymbol{\beta} \in \Delta$ also $w(\boldsymbol{\beta}) \in \Delta$ for all
    $w \in W$. Moreover, it can be shown that $\boldsymbol{\beta} \in Q$ is a root
    if and only if $|\boldsymbol{\beta}| \le 2$.
</p>

    Starting from the set of simple roots $\Pi$, we can now construct the entire
    root system of $\mathcal{F}$. Roots that are connected through Weyl transformations
    have the same multiplicity. For all other roots, we must compute the multiplicity
    using the Weyl character formula. This is described in more detail in section
    <a href="#Multiplicities">7</a> below.
</p>
<p>
    A general root $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ has root vector
    $\boldsymbol{\alpha} =  a_{-1} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} + a_0 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0 + a_1 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1$
    with $a_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ and either all $a_i \ge 0$ or all $a_i \le 0$.
    We call $-a_{-1}$ the <u>level</u> of a root; $-a_0$ is the
    <u>depth</u>, and $a_0 - a_1$ is the spin label (or <u>weight</u>).
    So, positive level and depth are associated with negative roots. In the first
    figure above, we sliced the root system into planes of equal level and
    only considered the negative roots. The two axes of the plot are the depth
    and spin label of the roots. The picture with negative level is obtained
    from a reflection of the plot across the x-axis. When hovering the mouse 
    over a root, the root vector is shown without the minus signs to improve 
    the readability. The second figure we consider the entire root system 
    with the roots of different levels stacked on top of each other in the
    $z$ direction.

  <p>
    VisualLie is a web app to visualize the root system of
    the Feingold-Frenkel algebra. It comes in the form of a single 
    VisualLie.html file that can be opened with any modern 
    web browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Feingold-Frenkel algebra \(\mathcal{F}\) (or \(AE_3\) or 
    \(A_1^{++}\)). It is a rank 3 hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra associated 
    with the indefinite Cartan matrix
  </p>
  <p>
  \[ A = (a_{ij}) =  \begin{pmatrix}2 & -1 & 0 \\ -1 & 2 & -2 \\ 0 & -2 & 2 \end{pmatrix} \, . \]
  </p>
  <p>
    Its study was pioneered in [1]. A slightly more comprehensive
    introduction to the Feingold-Frenkel algebra \(\mathcal{F}\)
    is given below the figure (to be added later).
  </p>
  <p>
    The figure shows the root system of \(\mathcal{F}\) for one level at 
    a time. The figure is fully interactive. Hover over a root to see its 
    root vector, norm, and multiplicity. Click on a root to see its Weyl orbit. 
    Use the bokeh plot tools on the right to pan, zoom, save, or reset the plot. 
    Use the selectors, checkboxes, and buttons on the left to change the level 
    of the visualized roots and turn on additional plot features.

# VisualLie

VisualLie is a web app to visualize the root system of the Feingold-Frenkel algebra.
It uses the Bokeh Python library to generate an interactive plot which is stored in the 
**VisualLie.html** file. The file can be opened with any modern web browser. 

The easiest way to get started with VisualLie is to download the **VisualLie.html** file
and open it with your favorite web browser.

## Getting Started
If you want to modify VisualLie or build the "VisualLie.html" yourself follow these steps. 

VisualLie requires a Python installation with [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html).
To install Bokeh using `pip`, enter

```
pip install bokeh
```

Then you can run **VisualLie.py** to build **VisualLie.html** using

```
python VisualLie.py
```

## Usage
VisualLie is self contained. When you open the **VisualLie.html** file with your favorite web browser
you are presented with a brief explanation how to interact with the plot and the mathematics behind it.

To learn more about the Bokeh plot tools visit 
[the Bokeh documentation](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/tools.html).

## Rootsystem
Included in VisualLie is a Python package called **rootsystem**. It constructs the root system
of the Feingold-Frenkel algebra. 

This package is based on based the SimpLie programm written by Teake Nutma, which is available
at https://github.com/teake/simplie.

**rootsystem** requires a Python installation with [numPy](https://numpy.org/).
To install numPy using `pip`, enter

```
pip install numpy
```

The package is then called with one optional argument from the command line.
The argument is the height up to which the root system will be constructed.
If no argument is given the calculation defaults to a height of 76.

Upon executing the rootsystem package the root system is automatically constructed 
up to the given height and stored as a csv file in the data/ folder. 
The first three numbers in each row are the root vector and
the last number is the multiplicity of that root.

To run the package type

```
python -m rootsystem [HEIGHT]
```
where [HEIGHT] is the optional argument that must be replaced by either nothing
or a positive integers. 

Note that the root multiplicities are very large numbers. When constructing the
root system of the Feingold-Frenkel algebra for heights > 80 there are some issues due
to the dealing with numbers which are greater than 2^64. This will hopefully be fixed in 
a future version.

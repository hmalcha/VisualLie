<p>
  VisualLie is a web app to visualize the root system of the
  Feingold-Frenkel algebra.
</p>
<p>
  The Feingold-Frenkel algebra $\mathcal{F}$ (or $AE_3$ or 
  $A_1^{++}$) is a rank 3 hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra associated
  with the indefinite Cartan matrix

  \begin{align}\label{eq:CM}
  A = (a_{ij}) =  \begin{pmatrix}2 & -1 & 0 \\ -1 & 2 & -2 \\ 0 & -2 & 2 \end{pmatrix} \, .
  \end{align}

  Its study was pioneered in [<a href="#FF">1</a>]. Below the figure, we
  give a more comprehensive introduction to the Feingold-Frenkel algebra
  $\mathcal{F}$ and, in particular, highlight some of the properties of
  its root system.
</p>
<p>
  The figure shows the root system of $\mathcal{F}$ for one level at a
  time. The notion of level is explained below the figure. The figure is
  fully interactive. Hover over a root to see its root vector, norm, and
  multiplicity. Click on a root to see its Weyl orbit. Use the bokeh plot
  tools on the right to pan, zoom, save, or reset the plot. Use the selectors,
  checkboxes, and buttons on the left to change the level of the visualized
  roots and turn on additional plot features.

<p>
    In the following, we mostly use the notation and conventions of
    [<a href="#KacBook">2</a>]. The matrix \eqref{eq:CM} is a so-called generalized
    Cartan matrix. As such, it satisfies the following conditions:
</p>
    <ol>
        <li>$a_{ii} = 2$ for $i = -1, 0, 1$.</li>
        <li>$a_{ij}$ are nonpositive integers for $i \not= j$.</li>
        <li>$a_{ij}= 0$ implies $a_{ji} = 0$.</li>
    </ol>
<p>
    We call a Cartan matrix indecomposable if there is no decomposition of
    the sets of indices $I$ into a disjoint union of non-empty subsets $I_1$
    and $I_2$ such that $a_{ij} = 0$ for all $i$ in $I_1$ and $j$ in $I_2$.
    A Cartan matrix $C$ is called symmetrizable if there exists a diagonal matrix
    $D$ (with positive integer entries) and a symmetric matrix $S$ such that $C = DS$.
    Assuming that C is symmetrizable and indecomposable, there are three types of
    generalized Cartan matrices:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If $S$ is positive definite $C$ is of finite type.</li>
        <li>If $S$ is positive semi-definite $C$ is of affine type.</li>
        <li>If $S$ is indefinite $C$ is of indefinite type.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    For Cartan matrices of indefinite type, there is a special subclass. A generalized
    Cartan matrix is said to be of hyperbolic type if it is of indefinite type, but for
    any proper subset of $I$, the corresponding submatrix is of finite or affine type.
    In particular, \eqref{eq:CM} is of hyperbolic type.
</p>
<p>
    A realization of \eqref{eq:CM} is a triple $(\mathfrak{h}, \Pi, \Pi^\vee)$, where
    $\mathfrak{h}$ is a complex vector space and 
    $\Pi = \{ \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1}, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1 \} \subset \mathfrak{h}^\ast$
    and
    $\Pi^\vee = \{ \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1}^\vee, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0^\vee, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1^\vee \} \subset \mathfrak{h}$
    are indexed subsets in $\mathfrak{h}^\ast$ and $\mathfrak{h}$ respectively,
    satisfying the following conditions:
</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Both sets $\Pi$ and $\Pi^\vee$ are linearly independent.</li>
        <li>$\langle \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i , \boldsymbol{\alpha}_j^\vee \rangle = a_{ij}$ for $i,j = -1, 0, 1$.</li>
        <li>$\mathrm{rank} \, \mathcal{F}  + \mathrm{dim} \, \mathfrak{h} = 6$.</li>
    </ol>
<p>
    Here, $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is the usual pairing between a vector space and
    its dual. The elements of $\Pi$ are called simple roots, and the elements of $\Pi^\vee$
    are called simple co-roots. They form the root (respectively co-root) basis. In the
    following, we choose

    \begin{align}\label{eq:SimpleRoots}
    \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} = (1,0,0) \, , \quad \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0 = (0,1,0)\, ,
    \quad \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1=(0,0,1)
    \end{align}

    and find

    \begin{align}
    \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1}^\vee = (2,-1,0) \, , \quad \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0^\vee = (-1,2,-2)\, ,
    \quad \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1^\vee =(0,-2,2) \, .
    \end{align}

    $Q = \mathbb{Z}_{-1} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} + \mathbb{Z}_0 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0 + \mathbb{Z}_1 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1$
    is called the root lattice of $\mathcal{F}$. 
</p>

<p>
    Let $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g}(A)$ be a hyperbolic Kac-moody algebra associated with the Cartan matrix
    \eqref{eq:CM}. Then, its generators $\{e_i, f_i, h_i\}$ obey the commutation relations

    \begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
    &[h_i, h_j] = 0  \, , \quad \quad \quad [e_i,f_j] = \delta_{ij} h_i\\
    &[h_i, e_j] = a_{ij} \,  e_j \,  ,  \quad \ \, [h_i,f_j] = - a_{ij} \, f_j \, ,  \\[1.5ex]
    &\mathrm{ad}(e_i)^{1-a_{ij}}(e_j) = \mathrm{ad}(f_i)^{1-a_{ij}}(f_j) ,= 0\, .
    \end{aligned}
    \end{align}

    In particular $h_i \in \mathfrak{h}$ for $i=-1,0,1$. The algebra $\mathfrak{g}(A)$
    can then be decomposed into root spaces with respect to $\mathfrak{h}$

    \begin{align}
    \mathfrak{g}(A) = \bigoplus_{\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in Q} \mathfrak{g}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \, .
    \end{align}

    Here 
    $\mathfrak{g}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} = \{ x \in \mathfrak{g}(A) \ | \ [h,x] = \alpha(h) x \ \text{for all } h \in \mathfrak{h}\}$
    is the root space attached to $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, with $\mathfrak{g}_0 = \mathfrak{h}$.
    The number $\alpha = \mathrm{dim}(\mathfrak{g}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}})$ is called the
    multiplicity of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$. An element $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in Q$ is called
    a root if $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \not=0$ and $\mathrm{mult}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \not = 0$.
    We denote the set of all roots by $\Delta$. Every root is either positive
    (i.e. $\boldsymbol{\alpha} > 0$) or negative  (i.e. $\boldsymbol{\alpha} < 0$). Hence,
    the set of all roots $\Delta$ can be written as the disjoint union of the set of positive
    roots $\Delta_+$ and the set of negative roots $\Delta_-$. The simple roots are in $\Delta_+$,
    and they all have multiplicity one.

    <div id="text">
        
    


<p>
    A $\mathfrak{g}(A)$-module $V$ is called $\mathfrak{h}$-diagonalizable
    if $V = \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^\ast} V_\lambda$, where
    $V_\lambda = \{ v \in V \ | \ h(v) = \langle \lambda, h \rangle v \ \text{for} \ h \in \mathfrak{h} \}$.
    Then $V_\lambda$ is called weight space, $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^\ast$
    is called a weight if $V_\lambda \not= 0$, and $\mathrm{dim}(V_\lambda)$
    is called the multiplicity of $\lambda$ and is denoted by
    $\mathrm{mult}_V(\lambda)$. By
    $P(V) = \{\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^\ast \ | \ V_\lambda \not=0\}$
    we denote the set of weights of $V$.
</p>
<p>
    A module $V$ is called a highest weight module with highest weight
    $\boldsymbol{\Lambda} \in \mathfrak{h}^\ast$ if there exist a non-zero
    vector $v_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}} \in V$ such that 
    $e_i(v_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}) = 0$, 
    $h_i(v_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}) = \boldsymbol{\Lambda}(h) v_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}$
    for all $i = -1, 0, 1$ and if $U(\mathfrak{g}(A))(v_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}) = V$,
    where $U$ is the universal enveloping algebra. The vector $v_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}$
    is called a highest weight vector.
</p>
<p>
    An $\mathfrak{h}$-diagonizable module $V$ over a Kac-Moody algebra
    $\mathfrak{g}(A)$ is called integrable if all $e_i$ and $f_i$ ($i=-1,0,1$)
    are locally nilpotent on $V$. In the following, we denote integrable
    highest-weight modules by $L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda})$. It can be shown
    that the $\mathfrak{g}(A)$-module $L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda})$ is integrable
    if and only if $\boldsymbol{\Lambda} \in P_+$ with 
    $P_+ = \{ \lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^\ast \ | \ \langle \lambda , \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i^\vee \rangle \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \ \text{for all} \ i = -1, 0, 1\}$.

    Let $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^\ast$. For each $i = -1, 0, 1$ we define
    the fundamental Weyl reflection $r_i$ of the space $\mathfrak{h}^\ast$ by
    
    \begin{align}
    r_i(\lambda) = \lambda - \left< \lambda, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i^\vee \right> \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i \, .
    \end{align}
    The subgroup $W \subset \mathrm{GL}(\mathfrak{h}^\ast)$ generated by
    all fundamental reflections is called the Weyl group of $\mathfrak{g}(A)$.
</p>
<p>
    A root $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \Delta$ is called real if there exists
    $w \in W$ such that $w(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ is a simple root. For the
    Feingold-Frenkel algebra $\mathcal{F}$ all real roots have norm 2, i.e.
    $ (\boldsymbol{\alpha} , \boldsymbol{\alpha} ) = 2$. Here $(\cdot, \cdot)$
    is the symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form defined by
    $(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_j) = a_{ij}$. 
</p>
<p>
    The following statements about real roots $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ are
    important for constructing the root system of $\mathcal{F}$:
</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>$\mathrm{mult}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = 1$.</li>
        <li>$k  \boldsymbol{\alpha}$ is a root if and only of $k = \pm 1$.</li>
        <li>
            If $ \boldsymbol{\beta} \in \Delta$ then there exist nonnegative
            integers $p$ and $q$ related by the equation

            \begin{align}\label{eq:Root}
            p-q = \left<  \boldsymbol{\beta},  \boldsymbol{\alpha}^\vee \right> \, , 
            \end{align}

            such that $\boldsymbol{\beta} + k \boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \Delta \cup \{0\}$
            if and only if $-p \le k \le q$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p> 
    A root that is not real is called imaginary. Imaginary roots have norm $\le 0$.
    From the statements above, it follows in particular that if
    $\boldsymbol{\beta} \in \Delta$ also $w(\boldsymbol{\beta}) \in \Delta$ for all
    $w \in W$. Moreover, it can be shown that $\boldsymbol{\beta} \in Q$ is a root
    if and only if $|\boldsymbol{\beta}| \le 2$.
</p>
<p>
    Starting from the set of simple roots $\Pi$, we can now construct the entire
    root system of $\mathcal{F}$. Roots that are connected through Weyl transformations
    have the same multiplicity. For all other roots, we must compute the multiplicity
    using the Weyl character formula. This is described in more detail in section
    <a href="#Multiplicities">7</a> below.
</p>
<p>
    A general root $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ has root vector
    $\boldsymbol{\alpha} =  a_{-1} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} + a_0 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0 + a_1 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1$
    with $a_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ and either all $a_i \ge 0$ or all $a_i \le 0$.
    We call $-a_{-1}$ the <u>level</u> of a root; $-a_0$ is the
    <u>depth</u>, and $a_0 - a_1$ is the spin label (or <u>weight</u>).
    So, positive level and depth are associated with negative roots. In the
    figure above, we sliced the root system into planes of equal level and
    only considered the negative roots. The two axes of the plot are the depth
    and spin label of the roots. The picture with negative level is obtained
    from a reflection of the plot across the x-axis. For a plot of the entire
    root system, one can imagine the roots of different levels stacked on top
    of each other in the $z$ direction. When hovering the mouse over a root,
    the root vector is shown without the minus signs to improve the readability.

            <h2>4 Classifying the Highest Weight Representations</h2>
        </body>
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        
    


<p>
    To classify the integrable highest weight representations,
    we introduce the fundamental weights $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_i$
    satisfying
    $\langle \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_i , \boldsymbol{\alpha}_j^\vee \rangle = \delta_{ij}$
    such that
    
    \begin{align}
    \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{-1} = - \boldsymbol{\delta} \, , 
    \quad \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0 = - \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} - 2 \boldsymbol{\delta} \, ,
    \quad \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_1 = - \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} - 2 \boldsymbol{\delta} + \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1 \, ,
    \end{align}
    
    where $\boldsymbol{\delta} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0 + \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1$
    is the so-called affine null root. It follows that the level $\ell$ of a
    root $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ is $\ell =  (\boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\delta})$.
    The fundamental weights form a basis of the weight lattice
    $P = \mathbb{Z}_{-1} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{-1} + \mathbb{Z}_0 \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0 + \mathbb{Z}_1 \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_1$.
    The highest weight modules at level $\ell$ are then given by
    
    \begin{align}
    L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}) = L(p \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0 + 2 q \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_1 + r \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{-1}) 
    \quad \text{with} \quad p + 2q = \ell \quad \text{and} \quad p,q,r \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \, .
    \end{align}

    Here we have $2q$ so that $\boldsymbol{\Lambda} \in Q$. We show that
    $L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda})$ is integrable and that the highest weight
    $\boldsymbol{\Lambda} \in \Delta$. Clearly $\boldsymbol{\Lambda} \in \mathfrak{h}^\ast$.
    Moreover, $\langle \boldsymbol{\Lambda} , \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i^\vee \rangle \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$
    because $p,q,r \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$. Finally it is not hard to check that $|\boldsymbol{\Lambda}| \le 0$,
    hence $\boldsymbol{\Lambda} \in \Delta$. Since the fundamental weights form a basis of the weight lattice,
    these are, in fact, all the highest weight modules at level $\ell$.

        </body>
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        
    


<p>
    In [<a href="#FF">1</a>], it was shown that there exists a decomposition
    of $\mathcal{F}$ with respect to a rank 2 affine subalgebra.
    Consider the generalized Cartan matrix
    
    \begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix} 2 & -2 \\ -2 & 2 \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align}

    and the associated affine subalgebra $A_1^{(1)}$ of $\mathcal{F}$
    generated by $\{e_i, f_i, h_i \ | \ i = 1, 2 \}$. An explicit
    description of $A_1^{(1)}$ is given by

    \begin{align}
    A_1^{(1)} = \mathrm{span}_\mathbb{R} \left\{ E_m, F_m, H_m \, (m \in \mathbb{Z}) , K , \mathfrak{d} \right\}
    \end{align}

    with the standard commutation relations

    \begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
    &[H_m, E_m] = 2 E_{m+n},  &&[H_m, F_m] = -2F_{m+n} \, , \\
    &[E_m, F_n] = H_{m+n} + m K \delta_{m+n,0} \, ,  &&[H_m, H_n] = 2m K \delta_{m+n,0} \, , \\
    &[E_m, E_n] = [F_m, F_n] = 0 \, .
    \end{aligned}
    \end{align}

    Furthermore,

    \begin{align}
    K = h_0 + h_1 \, , \quad \mathfrak{d} = h_{-1} + h_0 + h_1 \, ,
    \end{align}

    where $K$ commutes with all affine generators and
    $\mathfrak{d}$ is the depth counting operator with

    \begin{align}
    [\mathfrak{d}, T_m] = - m T_m \quad \text{for all} \quad T_m \in \{E_m, F_m, H_m\} \, .
    \end{align}

    Together with $h_1$, the operators $K$ and $\mathfrak{d}$ span the 
    Cartan subalgebra $A_1^{(1)}$ of $\mathcal{F}$. After these preparations 
    the algebra $\mathcal{F}$ can be decomposed into eigenspaces of $K$

    \begin{align}
    \mathcal{F} = \bigoplus_{\ell \in \mathbb{Z}} \mathcal{F}^{(\ell)}
    \end{align}

    In particular $\mathcal{F}^{(0)} = A_1^{(1)}$ and 
    $\mathcal{F}^{(1)} = L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0)$. The highest weight vector 
    in $L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0)$ is 
    $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0 + 2 \boldsymbol{\delta} = - \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1}$. 
    This is the level decomposition of $\mathcal{F}$, and it is exactly what is 
    shown in the figure above. Each subspace $\mathcal{F}^{(\ell)}$ decomposes into 
    (generally infinitely many) irreducible representations of $A_1^{(1)}$. 
    The subspace $\mathcal{F}^{(-\ell)}$ is conjugate to $\mathcal{F}^{(\ell)}$ 
    and thus needs not be studied separately. The level-$\ell$ subspace 
    $\mathcal{F}^{(\ell)}$ is spanned by the multi-commutators 
    $[f_{i_1}, \ldots , [f_{i_{n-1}}, f_{i_n}] \ldots]$ with $\ell$ generators 
    $f_{-1}$. Subsequently, it can be shown that [<a href="#FF">1</a>]

    \begin{align}
    \mathcal{F}^{(\ell)} = \left[ \mathcal{F}^{(1)} , \mathcal{F}^{(\ell-1)} \right] \, .

            <h2>6 The Weyl Group Action</h2>
        </body>
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        
    


<p>
    In this section we discuss the Weyl group $\hat{W}$ of the affine
    subalgebra $A_1^{(1)}$ of $\mathcal{F}$. $\hat{W}$ is generated 
    by the fundamental reflections $r_0$ and $r_1$ acting on 
    $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^\ast$

    \begin{align}
    r_i(\lambda) = \lambda - \left< \lambda, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i^\vee \right>  \boldsymbol{\alpha} _i \, .
    \end{align}

    Two features are built into the figure to understand the action 
    of the Weyl group $\hat{W}$. Clicking on a root highlights all 
    roots (up to the maximum depth of the plot) in the Weyl orbit of 
    that root. Moreover, a line is drawn through the roots. 
    Feingold-Frenkel have shown that this line is always a parabola. 
    For a root 
    $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = a_{-1} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} + a_0 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0 + a_1 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1$ 
    the parabola is described through the equation

    \begin{align}
    f(x) = - \frac{1}{a_{-1}} \left( x^2 + a_{-1} a_0  -  (a_0 - a_1)^2 \right) \, .
    \end{align}

    When clicking the <u>Weyl reflection</u> checkbox, two lines are 
    drawn into the root lattice. They visualize the fundamental Weyl reflections.
    The reflection $r_1$ amounts to a horizontal reflection across the line 
    labeled $r_1$. Similarly, the reflection $r_0$ amounts to a diagonal 
    reflection across the line labeled $r_0$. Notice that the $r_0$ line 
    moves to the right as we increase the level. The direction of these 
    reflections is also indicated by the arrows in the top left corner of 
    the figure.
</p>
<p> 
    There is one decomposition of the Weyl group for which the calculation
    of Weyl orbits becomes particularly simple. Let 
    $t(\lambda) = r_1 (r_0(\lambda))$. Then $T = \{t^n \ | \ n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ 
    is called the group of translations. It can then be shown that

    \begin{align}
    \hat{W} = \{ r_1 \} \ltimes T \, .
    \end{align}

    In the plot, one can switch between the <u>full Weyl group orbit</u>
    and the <u>translation group orbit</u> with the buttons on the 
    left-hand side. Interestingly, these two orbits start to differ only 
    from level 3 onward.

        </body>
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        
    


<p>
    In this section, we explain how the root multiplicities are calculated.
</p>
<p>
    A useful way to decode the entire information of an integrable 
    highest-weight module into a compact expression is the formal character 
    formula

    \begin{align}
    \mathrm{ch}(L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda})) = \sum_{\lambda \in P(\boldsymbol{\Lambda})} \mathrm{mult}(\lambda) e^\lambda \, .
    \end{align}

    This formula is in one-to-one correspondence with the figure above.
    For example the level 1 of $\mathcal{F}$ is given by 
    $\mathcal{F}^{(1)} = L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0)$ and its 
    character is

    \begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
    \mathrm{ch}(\mathcal{F}_1) = \mathrm{ch} (L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_1)) 
    &= 1 \cdot e^{-\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1}} 
    + 1 \cdot e^{-\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} - \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0} 
    +  1 \cdot e^{-\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} - \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0 - \boldsymbol{a}_1}  
    + 1  \cdot e^{-\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} - \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0 - 2 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1} \\
    &\quad  + 1  \cdot e^{-\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} - 2 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0 -  \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1}   
    + 2  \cdot e^{-\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1} - 2 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_0 - 2 \boldsymbol{\alpha}_1} + \ldots
    \end{aligned}
    \end{align}

    To compute the multiplicities, we need to introduce some additional 
    notation. Let $w = r_{1_1} \ldots r_{i_s} \in W$ be an element of 
    the Weyl group and $\epsilon(w) = (-1)^{\ell(w)}$. Here 
    $\ell(w) = s$ is the length of $w$, i.e., the minimal number of 
    repeated Weyl reflections $r_i$ one has to do to get $w$. Moreover, 
    let $\boldsymbol{\rho} = (1,1,1)$ be the Weyl vector of 
    $\mathfrak{g}(A)$. Then the Weyl-Kac character formula is [<a href="#Kac">3</a>]

    \begin{align}\label{eq:CharacterFormula}
    \mathrm{ch}(L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda})) = \frac{\sum\limits_{w \in W} \epsilon(w) 
    e^{-w(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}+\boldsymbol{\rho}) + \boldsymbol{\rho}}}{\prod\limits_{\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \Delta_+} 
    (1-e^{\boldsymbol{\alpha}})^{\mathrm{mult}({\boldsymbol{\alpha})}}} \, .
    \end{align}

    A particularly simple case arises when we specialize to the 1-dimensional 
    trivial representation $L(0) = \mathbb{C}$. The resulting formula is 
    known as the denominator formula

    \begin{align}\label{eq:DenominatorFormula}
    \sum_{w \in W} \epsilon(w) e^{-w(\boldsymbol{\rho})+\boldsymbol{\rho}} 
    = \prod_{\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \Delta_+} (1-e^{\boldsymbol{\alpha}})^{\mathrm{mult}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})} \, .
    \end{align}

    By expanding both sides and comparing coefficients, we can, in principle, 
    obtain the multiplicities $\mathrm{mult}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ of all the 
    root $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \Delta_+$. However, there is a more efficient 
    and elegant way due to Peterson that we will outline below.
</p>
<p>
    We call the denominator of \eqref{eq:CharacterFormula}

    \begin{align}
    R= \prod_{\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \Delta_+} (1-e^{\boldsymbol{\alpha}})^{\mathrm{mult}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})}
    \end{align}

    and introduce the so-called co-multiplicity

    \begin{align}
    c_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}  =  \sum_{k \ge 1} \frac{1}{k} \, \mathrm{mult} \left( \frac{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}{k} \right) \, .
    \end{align}

    Here the sum is only over those $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}$, 
    where $\boldsymbol{\alpha}/k \in Q$. Then, it is not hard 
    to show that 

    \begin{align}
    F  = - \log R= \sum_{\boldsymbol{\beta}>0} c_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} e^{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \, , 
    \end{align}

    Here the sum is no longer over the roots $\alpha \in \Delta_+$ but 
    over all root multiples, i.e. all $\boldsymbol{\beta} \in Q$ such 
    that $k \boldsymbol{\alpha} = \boldsymbol{\beta}$ for some 
    $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \Delta_+$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}$. 
    Root multiples can have co-multiplicity $> 0$, but their 
    multiplicity is always zero.
</p>
<p>   
    Then we choose an orthonormal basis $u_i$ of the Cartan subalgebra 
    and take the Laplacian  $\sum_i \partial_i^2$ (where 
    $\partial_i e^{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}(u_i)e^{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}$) 
    of the denominator formula \eqref{eq:DenominatorFormula} 

    \begin{align}
    \sum_i \partial_i^2 R = 2  \sum_i \boldsymbol{\rho}(u_i) \partial_i R \, .
    \end{align}

    This implies

    \begin{align}
    \sum_i \left( (\partial_i F)^2 - \partial_i^2 F \right) 
    = - 2 \sum_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}>0} c_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} (\boldsymbol{\alpha} , \boldsymbol{\rho}) e^{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \, .
    \end{align}

    Expanding the left-hand side yields

    \begin{align}
    \sum_i \left( (\partial_i F)^2 - \partial_i^2 F \right) 
    = \sum_i \left( \sum_{\boldsymbol{\beta} > 0} c_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \, \boldsymbol{\beta}(u_i) e^{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \right) 
    \left( \sum_{\boldsymbol{\gamma} > 0} c_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \boldsymbol{\gamma}(u_i) e^{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \right) 
    - \sum_{\boldsymbol{\alpha} > 0} c_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}  (\boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\alpha}) e^{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}
    \end{align}

    and by comparing coefficients, we arrive at the 
    \textbf{Peterson recursion formula}

    \begin{align}\label{eq:PetersonFormula}
    (\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{\alpha} - 2 \boldsymbol{\rho}) c_\alpha 
    = \sum_{\substack{\boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\gamma} > 0 \\ 
    \boldsymbol{\beta} +\boldsymbol{\gamma} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}}} c_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} c_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} 
    \,  (\boldsymbol{\beta} , \boldsymbol{\gamma}) \, .
    \end{align}

    This formula tells us that we obtain the multiplicity of a root 
    $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ from the sum of the co-multiplicities of all 
    root multiplets $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$, 
    where $\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\gamma} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}$. 
    Thus, the steps to find new roots in section <a href="#RootSystem">3</a> 
    together with \eqref{eq:PetersonFormula} allow us to iteratively 
    construct the root system of the Feingold-Frenkel algebra $\mathcal{F}$ 
    starting from the set of simple roots \eqref{eq:SimpleRoots}.

<p>
    At lower levels, it is possible to significantly improve the 
    recursive construction of the root system.
</p>
<p>
    Having a closer look at the level 1 of $\mathcal{F}$, we notice 
    that the multiplicities in each string of roots extending into 
    the $-y$ direction are the same. This is because the Weyl orbit 
    of the highest weight $-\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-1}$ contains the 
    ends of all these root strings. It has been shown that the 
    multiplicities in these root strings are nothing but the integer 
    partitions. Hence, we can obtain them all from the generating 
    function

    \begin{align}\label{eq:phi}
    \varphi(q) = \prod_{i \ge 1} \frac{1}{(1-q^n)} = 1 + q + q^2 + 2 q^3 + 3 q^3 + 5 q^4 + \ldots 
    \end{align}

    We call $\varphi(q)$ a string function. Subsequently we can 
    write the character of $\mathcal{F}_1 = L(\Lambda_1)$ as

    \begin{align}\label{eq:chF1}
    \mathrm{ch}(\mathcal{F}_1) = \mathrm{ch}(L(\boldsymbol{\Lambda_1})) 
    = \varphi(q) \, \Theta_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda_1}} \, ,  \quad \text{with} 
    \quad  q = e^{-\boldsymbol{\delta}}
    \end{align}

    and where for any weight $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^\ast$ of level $\ell$

    \begin{align}
    \Theta_\lambda = e^{- \frac{|\lambda|^2}{2\ell} \boldsymbol{\delta}} \sum_{t \in T} e^{t(\lambda)} \, .
    \end{align}

    At higher levels, the equation \eqref{eq:chF1} becomes much 
    more complicated. Already at level 2, we need two string 
    functions to describe the character of $V(2\Lambda_1)$, and 
    neither of them is as simple as \eqref{eq:phi}. To describe 
    the character of $\mathcal{F}_2$, a total of four string 
    functions are needed. 
</p>
<p>
    In general, one can write for any highest-weight representation

    \begin{align}
    \mathrm{ch}V(\boldsymbol{i \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0 + j \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_1}) 
     \sum_{m,n}  C_{ij}^{mn} \ \Theta_{m \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_0 + n \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_1} \, .
    \end{align}

    The difficulty is then to figure out the string string 
    functions $C_{ij}^{mn}$. This has been done for all highest weight 
    representations up to level 2 in [<a href="#FF">1</a>] and up to level 
    3 in [<a href="#BB">4</a>].
